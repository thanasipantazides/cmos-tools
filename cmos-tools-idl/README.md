# `cmos-tools-idl`

A repository to store all software tools for the CMOS system used for the FOXSI mission in IDL.

There is an "examples" and a "tests" folder. The "examples" folder is a great place to include scripts that show how some of the code in the repository works and the "tests" folder is a fantastic place to put code that tests the tools that have been created.

More information will be placed here with regards as to how this package is recommended to be used.
